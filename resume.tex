% About/Summary
\section{About}
Lead Backend Engineer with 10+ years of experience building backend systems, CI/CD pipelines, and performance optimization. Reduced invoice processing time from 2 days to 2 hours at Clipboard Health. Built CI/CD pipelines with 10-minute deployments. Converted legacy systems into microservices. Works best with clear goals and fast feedback loops.

% Core Strengths
\section{Core Strengths}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Performance Optimization \& Testing}: Delivered sub-500ms report loading times by rewriting struggling ad-impression ETL pipeline handling over 1M requests/day using K6 load testing and ClickHouse event-driven storage, with expertise in system debugging and bottleneck analysis
\item \textbf{CI/CD \& DevOps}: Empowered team of 5 developers to achieve daily releases by building CI/CD pipelines with Docker and GitHub Actions, incorporating Jest automated testing, with proficiency in Terraform and AWS ECS
\item \textbf{Backend System Development}: Minimized maintenance dependencies by refactoring legacy code into independent subsystems using custom Git filter-branch scripts, leading to seamless onboarding for 100+ engineers, leveraging TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS, and event-driven microservices architecture
\item \textbf{Cross-functional Collaboration}: Facilitated product managers and 3-5 developers to minimize design back-and-forth through attentive listening, note-taking, and clarifying questions, integrating complex systems like Stripe and Keycloak
\item \textbf{Full-Stack Technical Expertise}: Proficient across databases (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Aurora RDS), frontend technologies (React, Next.js, Qt/C++), cloud platforms (AWS, SQS/EventBridge, Datadog), and real-time systems integration
